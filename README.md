# WWTS — What Would Taylor Say?

**WWTS** is a small web app that offers gentle life advice inspired by the emotional themes and storytelling tone often found in heartfelt pop songwriting about love, loss, growth, memory, and healing.

It’s designed to feel like:

> a trusted friend writing back to you after midnight
> steady, kind, and quietly hopeful.

This project is intentionally simple.
The goal is not perfection — only something **soft, useful, and alive**.

## ✨ MVP Goal

A user can:

1. Ask a life question
2. Receive a single, comforting response
3. Feel understood for a moment

Nothing more.

The MVP **does not include**:

* Accounts or authentication
* Chat history
* Song-by-song citations
* Monetization
* Complex UI

If it doesn’t help answer **one question well**, it belongs after MVP.

## 🧠 How it works

WWTS connects a simple React interface to an OpenAI agent that:

* responds with empathy and emotional clarity
* uses original language inspired by common themes in love and growing up
* **does not quote copyrighted lyrics**
* keeps answers concise, warm, and reflective

The focus is emotional usefulness, not imitation.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **React + Vite**
* **TypeScript**
* **OpenAI Agent / API** (planned connection after UI MVP)
* Minimal CSS (intentional simplicity)

## 🚀 Getting started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL shown in the terminal
(usually `http://localhost:5173`).

If you see the WWTS title screen, the app is running.

## 📁 Project structure (early)

```
wwts/
  src/
    App.tsx
    main.tsx
  index.html
  package.json
```

This will grow slowly and intentionally.

## 🌱 Development philosophy

This project follows a few gentle rules:

* **Small steps are real progress**
* **Ship feelings before features**
* **Clarity over cleverness**
* **Done is kinder than perfect**

WWTS is meant to stay **tiny, calm, and human**.

---

## 🗺 Future possibilities (after MVP)

* Choose an emotional “era”
* Daily advice card
* Shareable quote images
* Journaling mode
* Mobile-first design
* Save meaningful responses

Only after the core experience feels true.

## 🤍 Why this exists

Sometimes people don’t need solutions.
They just need words that help them breathe a little easier.

WWTS is a small attempt to offer that moment of quiet understanding
through software.
